            Virbos is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution based on ArchBTW Linux that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required. <br><br>
            Virbos defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions or modifications. It ships software as released by the original developers (upstream) with minimal distribution-specific (downstream) changes: patches not accepted by upstream are avoided, and VirbOS's downstream patches consist almost entirely of backported bug fixes that are obsoleted by the project's next release.
